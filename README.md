## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

### Google Collaboratory

1. Open the notebook in Google Collaboratory.
2. Run each cell sequentially.
3. Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed in the Collaboratory environment.

### Local Environment

1. Set up a virtual environment on your local machine.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.

We hope you succeed in running the notebook in both environments. Good luck!
